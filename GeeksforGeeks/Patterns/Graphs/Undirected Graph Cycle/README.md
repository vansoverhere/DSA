### 📜 Problem Description

Given an undirected graph **** with  **V**  vertices and **E** edges, represented as a 2D vector  **edges[][]** , where each entry edges[i] = [u, v] denotes an edge between vertices u and v, determine whether the graph contains a cycle **** or not.

**Note:**  The graph can have multiple component. ![image](C:\Users\Mukul kumar\Desktop\GFG_PIC.JPG)

**Examples:**

```
Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
 
1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 is a cycle.

```

```
Input: V = 4, E = 3, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
 
No cycle in the graph.

```

**Constraints:** 1 ≤ V, E ≤ 105
0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < V
