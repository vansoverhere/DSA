### 📜 Problem Description

You are given an integer array  `nums` . Transform  `nums`  by performing the following operations in the  **exact**  order specified:

	
1. Replace each even number with 0.
	
2. Replace each odd numbers with 1.
	
3. Sort the modified array in  **non-decreasing**  order.

Return the resulting array after performing these operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  nums = [4,3,2,1]

**Output:**  [0,0,1,1]

**Explanation:**

	
- Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (3 and 1) with 1. Now,  `nums = [0, 1, 0, 1]` .
	
- After sorting  `nums`  in non-descending order,  `nums = [0, 0, 1, 1]` .

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  nums = [1,5,1,4,2]

**Output:**  [0,0,1,1,1]

**Explanation:**

	
- Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (1, 5 and 1) with 1. Now,  `nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]` .
	
- After sorting  `nums`  in non-descending order,  `nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` .

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
	
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
