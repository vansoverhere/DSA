### 📜 Problem Description

Given an integer array  `nums` , in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in  **any order** .

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0]
Output: [-1,0]

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
	
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
	
- Each integer in  `nums`  will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.
